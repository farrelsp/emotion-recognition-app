# Emotion Recognition App  

A Streamlit-based application for recognizing emotions in social media texts, specifically tweets. The app leverages a fine-tuned **IndoBERT** model to classify emotions into eight categories:  
- Anger  
- Anticipation  
- Disgust  
- Fear  
- Joy  
- Sadness  
- Surprise  
- Trust  

This project also includes an API powered by **Uvicorn** for efficient backend handling.  

## ðŸ›  Project Structure  
The repository is organized into two main folders:  
1. **finetune**: Contains the following resources for training the emotion recognition model:  
   - A Jupyter Notebook for fine-tuning IndoBERT  
   - The dataset used for training and testing  
   - Utility scripts for preprocessing and model training  

2. **deploy**: Contains the files necessary to deploy the app, including the Streamlit frontend and Uvicorn API backend.  

## ðŸš€ Features  
- Predicts emotions from user-provided text  
- Built-in fine-tuning resources for IndoBERT  
- Lightweight deployment setup

## ðŸ“š Dataset
The dataset used for fine-tuning IndoBERT is included in the finetune folder. Details about the dataset and preprocessing steps can be found in the provided Jupyter Notebook.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
- **Streamlit**: For building the web app  
- **Uvicorn**: For running the API backend  

## ðŸ”§ Installation Instructions
